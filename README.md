# UPDATE 12/20/2023 4PM

It looks like Discord has fixed this exploit and is not allowing codes to be claimed anymore. Broken until further notice.

# OperaGX Nitro Generator

This simple Python script uses the Discord X OperaGX promotion API across multiple user agents to fetch a one-month nitro token redeem link.

**This is essentially a nitro one-month trial generator.**

The promotion is bound by the following terms:

THIS 1-MONTH DISCORD NITRO OFFER IS AVAILABLE TO OPERA GX USERS. REDEEM BY 11:59 PM ET ON JULY 16, 2024. VALID FOR DISCORD USERS WHO HAVE NOT SUBSCRIBED TO NITRO WITHIN THE PAST 12 MONTHS. VALID FORM OF PAYMENT REQUIRED AT SIGN-UP. AT THE END OF THE 1-MONTH FREE TRIAL PERIOD, YOUR NITRO SUBSCRIPTION WILL CONVERT TO A MONTHLY RECURRING SUBSCRIPTION, AND YOU WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY CHARGED THE STANDARD SUBSCRIPTION PRICE, $9.99. USE OF DISCORD AND NITRO IS SUBJECT TO THE DISCORD TERMS OF SERVICE AND PRIVACY POLICY.

How to use:

1. Clone this repo.
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Change settings in `settings.ini`.
4. Run `main.py`
5. Profit

Codes are written as gift links into `links.txt` after the script has stopped running or after you've keyboard interrupted.

Any account can redeem the codes.

If it doesn't allow you to redeem, **RTFM** (T&C). *You probably had Nitro in the last year.*
